This is the first project of the Capstone Project Series, which consists of 3 different project that contain different scenarios.\n","\n","This is a project which you will learn what is RFM? And how to apply RFM Analysis and Customer Segmentation using Clustering algorithms. Also you will improve your Data Cleaning, Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis capabilities. On the other hand you will create Cohort and Conduct Cohort Analysis.\n","\n","Before diving into the project, please take a look at the determines and project structure.\n","\n","- **NOTE:** This Project assumes that you already know the basics of coding in Python and are familiar with the theory behind Clustering.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1SCOFEfqiqa1"},"source":["# #Determines\n","\n","Using the [Online Retail dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository for exploratory data analysis, ***Customer Segmentation***, ***RFM Analysis***, ***Clustering*** and ***Cohort Analysis***.\n","\n","This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.\n","\n","Feature Information:\n","\n","**InvoiceNo**: Invoice number. *Nominal*, a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.\n","<br>\n","**StockCode**: Product (item) code. *Nominal*, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.\n","<br>\n","**Description**: Product (item) name. *Nominal*.\n","<br>\n","**Quantity**: The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. *Numeric*.\n","<br>\n","**InvoiceDate**: Invoice Date and time. *Numeric*, the day and time when each transaction was generated.\n","<br>\n","**UnitPrice**: Unit price. *Numeric*, Product price per unit in sterling.\n","<br>\n","**CustomerID**: Customer number. *Nominal*, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.\n","<br>\n","**Country**: Country name. *Nominal*, the name of the country where each customer resides.\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","First of all, to observe the structure of the data and missing values, you can use exploratory data analysis and data visualization techniques.\n","\n","You must do descriptive analysis. Because you must understand the relationship of the features to each other and clear the noise and missing values in the data. After that, the data set will be ready for RFM analysis.\n","\n","Before starting the RFM Analysis, you will be asked to do some analysis regarding the distribution of *Orders*, *Customers* and *Countries*. These analyzes will help the company develop its sales policies and contribute to the correct use of resources.\n","\n","You will notice that the UK not only has the most sales revenue, but also the most customers. So you will continue to analyze only UK transactions in the next RFM Analysis, Customer Segmentation and Clustering topics.\n","\n","Next, you will begin RFM Analysis, a customer segmentation technique based on customers' past purchasing behavior.\n","\n","By using RFM Analysis, you can enable companies to develop different approaches to different customer segments so that they can get to know their customers better, observe trends better, and increase customer retention and sales revenues.\n","\n","You will calculate the Recency, Frequency and Monetary values of the customers in the RFM Analysis you will make using the data consisting of UK transactions. Ultimately, you have to create an RFM table containing these values.\n","\n","In the Customer Segmentation section, you will create an RFM Segmentation Table where you segment your customers by using the RFM table. For example, you can label the best customer as \"Big Spenders\" and the lost customer as \"Lost Customer\".\n","\n","We will segment the customers ourselves based on their recency, frequency, and monetary values. But can an **unsupervised learning** model do this better for us? You will use the K-Means algorithm (any algorithm) to find the answer to this question. Then you will compare the classification made by the algorithm with the classification you have made yourself.\n","\n","Before applying Clustering, you should do data pre-processing. In this context, it will be useful to examine feature correlations and distributions.\n","\n","After the above operations, you will have made cluster estimation with clustering algorithms. You should visualize the cluster distribution by using a scatter plot. You can observe the properties of the resulting clusters with the help of the boxplot. Thus you will be able to tag clusters and interpret results.\n","\n","Finally, you will do Cohort Analysis with the data you used at the beginning, regardless of the analysis you have done before. Cohort analysis is a subset of behavioral analytics that takes the user data and breaks them into related groups for analysis. This analysis can further be used to do customer segmentation and track metrics like retention, churn, and lifetime value.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Our notes"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["- we can use any unsupervised machine learning algorithm\n","- RFM is for non-technical stakeholders e.g. used in marketing \n","- RFM Analysis is used to understand and segment customers based on their buying behaviour\n","- Cohort analysis is similar to segmentation based on some metrics\n","- https://medium.com/@ugursavci/customer-segmentation-using-rfm-analysis-in-python-218a3255f714 (later reading)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KQ62QseViqa2"},"source":["# #Project Structures\n","\n","- Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis\n","- RFM Analysis\n","- Customer Segmentation\n","- Applying Clustering\n","- Create Cohort and Conduct Cohort Analysis"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wsPQ1tUwiqa2"},"source":["# #Tasks\n","\n","#### 1.
